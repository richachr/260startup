## Specification Notes

I learned lots about useful commands in git that I had never used before, such as `git commit -am` and what pull requests are. I also learned about the importance of a good commit history and consistent work. I learned about mermaid and sequence diagrams. I also learned how to write things in VIM, like this sentence!

## AWS Notes

Do more research on Caddy. I learned that architecture diagrams can be made in Google Docs. I learned about DNS records: A (Address), CNAME (Alias), NS (Name Servers, verification). Layers: Application--HTTPS, Transport--TCP,Internet--IP, Link--Fiber, hardware.
