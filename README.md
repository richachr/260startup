# Rappt

[My Notes](notes.md)

A website to help medical professionals schedule appointments more intelligently, allowing emergency appointments to be accommodated by giving consideration to symptoms and urgency when scheduling appointments, instead of simply using a first-come-first-serve scheduling system and cancellation list.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever tried to schedule an urgent doctor's appointment, only to be met with a months long wait because nothing was available sooner? Are you a medical professional looking for a better way to triage patients before they come to the office? Rappt is the tool for you! With Rappt, patients can easily schedule appointments from the web, and our systems will use a custom algorithm to give them a scheduling window that is consistent with the urgency of their symptoms. Medical staff can see the schedule update in real time and make adjustments if necessary.

### Design

```

### Key features

- Single, secure HTTPS login for patients and healthcare workers.
- Ability for patients and healthcare workers to view relevant appointments and form information.
- Appointment scheduling based on weighted factors, giving users an appropriate window for appointments.
- Suggested diagnosis from public API (PubMedGPT) based on provided symptoms.
- Notifications for patients and healthcare professionals when appointment changes are made.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Webpages for login, submitting information (patients), scheduling an appointment (patients), and viewing/editing the schedule (patients and healthcare workers).
- **CSS** - Create a good looking website with modern design, animations, and responsive design that doesn't look as dreary as most medical websites.
- **React** - Login and form submission for appointments. Calculating severity based on weighted factors/information.
- **Service** - Save and fetch available appointments from database. Query PudMedGPT for severity analysis and possible diagnosis.
- **DB/Login** - Store and create entries for appointments and login information. Store sensetive medical information securely and authenticate to limit content access.
- **WebSocket** - Realtime notifications for changes in appointments from the patient or healthcare professional.
