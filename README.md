# Rappt

[My Notes](notes.md)

A website to help medical professionals schedule appointments more intelligently, allowing emergency appointments to be accommodated by giving consideration to symptoms and urgency when scheduling appointments, instead of simply using a first-come-first-serve scheduling system and cancellation list.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever tried to schedule an urgent doctor's appointment, only to be met with a months long wait because nothing was available sooner? Are you a medical professional looking for a better way to triage patients before they come to the office? Rappt is the tool for you! With Rappt, patients can easily schedule appointments from the web, and our systems will use a custom algorithm to give them a scheduling window that is consistent with the urgency of their symptoms. Medical staff can see the schedule update in real time and make adjustments if necessary.
